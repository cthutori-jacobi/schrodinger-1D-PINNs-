# Physics-Informed Neural Network for the Free Schrödinger Equation

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to solve the one-dimensional, free-particle Schrödinger equation  
using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). In natural units (ℏ = m = 1), the goal is to learn the complex wavefunction  
over a spatio-temporal domain by enforcing both  
1. the Schrödinger PDE itself, and  
2. the prescribed initial condition.
